# Create Custom Multi-Panel Visualizations with Tiledlayout

Create professional multi-panel figures using modern tiledlayout with performance-optimized code, custom styling, and flexible layouts.

## Metadata

- **Tags:** `matlab` `visualization` `tiledlayout` `plotting` `performance` `graphics`
- **MATLAB Release:** R2019b or newer (tiledlayout introduced in R2019b)
- **Required Toolboxes:** None

## The Prompt

```text
Create a MATLAB visualization using tiledlayout following these performance best practices:

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use tiledlayout() with FIXED grid dimensions (e.g., tiledlayout(2,3)) NOT flow layout
2. Use dot notation for property access (e.g., ax.XLabel.String) NOT set()/get()
3. Set axis limits manually using xlim(), ylim(), zlim() to prevent auto-calculation overhead
4. Create legend AFTER all plot objects exist, not incrementally
5. If axes interactivity is not needed, call disableDefaultInteractivity(ax)
6. If axes toolbar is not needed, set ax.Toolbar = []
7. Store graphics objects as variables for later property updates
8. DO NOT recreate plot objects in loops - update XData/YData properties instead

LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Specify number of rows and columns: tiledlayout(nRows, nCols)
- Use nexttile() to navigate between panels
- Set shared titles with title(tlo, 'Main Title')
- Configure spacing with TileSpacing and Padding properties

STYLING:
- Customize colors, line styles, markers
- Add labels, titles, legends appropriately
- Set consistent font sizes and styles across panels
- Use tight layout for publication quality

Create a visualization for: [DESCRIBE YOUR DATA AND LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS]

Include:
- Data generation or loading
- Optimized plotting code following best practices above
- Custom styling and labels
- Proper axis limits
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Specify layout dimensions:** Tell the AI exactly how many rows and columns you need (e.g., "2x3 grid layout")
2. **Describe each panel:** Explain what data should appear in each subplot
3. **Request specific styling:** Mention colors, line styles, markers, fonts if you have preferences
4. **Mention performance needs:** If creating animations or frequent updates, explicitly request optimized code
5. **Publication requirements:** Specify if you need high-resolution, print-ready figures

Create a visualization for: A 2x2 dashboard showing stock price analysis with:
- Top-left: Daily closing prices over 1 year as a line plot
- Top-right: Trading volume as a bar chart
- Bottom-left: 30-day moving average overlaid on prices
- Bottom-right: Daily returns histogram

Use blue color scheme, tight layout, and include grid lines.

Include:
- Data generation or loading
- Optimized plotting code following best practices above
- Custom styling and labels

Create a visualization for: A 1x3 layout comparing three experimental conditions:
- Panel 1: Control group measurements (scatter with error bars)
- Panel 2: Treatment A results (scatter with error bars)
- Panel 3: Treatment B results (scatter with error bars)

Use distinct colors for each condition, add statistical annotation boxes, and set y-axis range to [0, 100] for all panels.

- Optimized plotting code following best practices above
- Custom styling and labels
- Proper axis limits

### Example 3: Multi-Signal Comparison

Create a visualization for: A 3x1 vertical stack showing:

- Middle: Filtered signal
- Bottom: Difference between original and filtered

Use matching x-axes, different y-axis scales, and highlight the filtering cutoff frequency with a vertical line in all panels.

- Data generation or loading
- Optimized plotting code following best practices above
- Custom styling and labels
- Proper axis limits
```

## Expected Output

The AI will generate code structured like this:

```matlab
% Create figure with tiled layout
figure('Position', [100 100 1200 800]);
tlo = tiledlayout(nRows, nCols);
tlo.TileSpacing = 'compact';
tlo.Padding = 'compact';
title(tlo, 'Main Title', 'FontSize', 16, 'FontWeight', 'bold');

% Panel 1
ax1 = nexttile;
plot_obj1 = plot(x1, y1, 'LineWidth', 2);
ax1.XLabel.String = 'X Label';
ax1.YLabel.String = 'Y Label';
xlim(ax1, [xMin xMax]);
ylim(ax1, [yMin yMax]);
title(ax1, 'Panel 1 Title');
grid(ax1, 'on');

% Panel 2
ax2 = nexttile;
plot_obj2 = scatter(x2, y2, 50, 'filled');
% ... similar pattern for each panel
```

## Best Practices

- **Consistent styling:** Use the same color scheme and font sizes across all panels
- **Meaningful titles:** Each panel should have a clear, descriptive title
- **Proper legends:** Place legends where they don't obscure data
- **Axis labels:** Always label axes with units when applicable
- **Grid lines:** Add grid lines for easier data reading when appropriate

## Performance Notes

- Tiledlayout is faster than subplot for creating multi-panel figures
- Manual axis limits prevent flickering and improve update speed
- Dot notation is faster than set()/get() for property access
- Disabling unused features (interactivity, toolbar) speeds up creation
