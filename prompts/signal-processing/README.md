# Signal Processing

Prompts for designing filters, analyzing signals, and working with communications systems.

## Prompts in this Category

### [Design Digital Filter](design-digital-filter.md)
Design and analyze digital filters (lowpass, highpass, bandpass, bandstop) using various methods. Includes frequency response plots, pole-zero plots, and filter application examples.

**Tags:** `matlab` `signal-processing` `filter-design` `dsp` `butterworth` `chebyshev` `signal-processing-toolbox`
**Release:** Requires Signal Processing Toolbox&trade;

### [Analyze Signal Spectrum](analyze-signal-spectrum.md)
Perform frequency domain analysis using FFT and spectral analysis techniques. Includes proper scaling, power spectral density, and dominant frequency identification.

**Tags:** `matlab` `signal-processing` `fft` `spectral-analysis` `frequency-domain` `signal-processing-toolbox`
**Release:** Core FFT functions in base MATLAB&reg;, advanced features require Signal Processing Toolbox
