# Statistical Analysis with Hypothesis Testing

Perform comprehensive statistical analysis including hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and assumption checking.

## Metadata

- **Tags:** `matlab` `statistics` `hypothesis-testing` `anova` `t-test` `confidence-intervals`
- **MATLAB Release:** Requires Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- **Required Toolboxes:** Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## The Prompt

```text
Create a MATLAB script to perform statistical analysis on the provided data:

Analysis steps:
1. Load and explore data (summary statistics, distributions)
2. Check assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance)
3. Perform appropriate hypothesis test: [TEST TYPE: t-test, ANOVA, chi-square, etc.]
4. Calculate confidence intervals
5. Create visualizations (box plots, histograms, Q-Q plots)
6. Interpret results with clear comments

Data description: [DESCRIBE DATA]
Research question: [QUESTION]
Significance level: 0.05
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Describe your data:** Number of groups, sample sizes, measurement type
2. **State research question clearly:** Helps select appropriate test
3. **Mention assumptions:** If you know certain assumptions are violated
4. **Request specific visualizations:** QQ plots, box plots, etc.

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Two-Sample t-test

```
Create a MATLAB script to perform statistical analysis on the provided data:

Analysis steps:
1. Load and explore data (summary statistics, distributions)
2. Check assumptions (normality using Shapiro-Wilk, equal variances using Levene's test)
3. Perform independent samples t-test
4. Calculate 95% confidence intervals for mean difference
5. Create visualizations (box plots, histograms, Q-Q plots)
6. Interpret results with clear comments

Data description: Two groups (Control and Treatment), each with 30 continuous measurements
Research question: Is there a significant difference in mean response between Control and Treatment?
Significance level: 0.05
```

### Example 2: One-Way ANOVA

```
Create a MATLAB script to perform one-way ANOVA:

Data description: Three groups (Method A, Method B, Method C) with 25 samples each
Research question: Do the three methods produce significantly different mean outcomes?

Include:
- Descriptive statistics for each group
- Levene's test for homogeneity of variance
- One-way ANOVA
- Post-hoc comparisons (Tukey HSD) if significant
- Box plots and interaction plots
- Effect size (eta-squared)
```

### Example 3: Paired t-test

```
Create a MATLAB script for paired t-test analysis:

Data description: Before and after measurements on 40 subjects
Research question: Does the intervention produce a significant change in scores?
Significance level: 0.05

Include:
- Difference scores and their distribution
- Normality check for differences
- Paired t-test
- 95% CI for mean difference
- Scatter plot of before vs after with identity line
- Interpretation of practical significance
```

## Common Statistical Tests

### Two-Sample t-test
```matlab
[h, p, ci, stats] = ttest2(group1, group2);
```

### Paired t-test
```matlab
[h, p, ci, stats] = ttest(before, after);
```

### One-Way ANOVA
```matlab
[p, tbl, stats] = anova1(data, group);
multcompare(stats);  % Post-hoc comparisons
```

### Chi-Square Test
```matlab
[h, p, stats] = chi2gof(data);
```

### Correlation Test
```matlab
[r, p] = corrcoef(x, y);
```

## Assumption Checking

### Normality Tests
```matlab
% Shapiro-Wilk (requires Statistics Toolbox)
[h, p] = swtest(data);

% Lilliefors test
[h, p] = lillietest(data);

% Visual: Q-Q plot
qqplot(data);
```

### Homogeneity of Variance
```matlab
% Levene's test (requires custom function or Statistics Toolbox)
p = vartestn(data, group, 'TestType', 'LeveneAbsolute');

% Bartlett's test
p = vartestn(data, group, 'TestType', 'Bartlett');
```

## Visualization Templates

### Box Plot with Individual Points
```matlab
figure;
boxplot(data, group);
hold on;
scatter(ones(size(group1))*1, group1, 'jitter', 'on');
scatter(ones(size(group2))*2, group2, 'jitter', 'on');
ylabel('Response Variable');
title('Comparison of Groups');
```

### Histogram with Normal Fit
```matlab
figure;
histogram(data, 'Normalization', 'pdf');
hold on;
x = linspace(min(data), max(data), 100);
plot(x, normpdf(x, mean(data), std(data)), 'r-', 'LineWidth', 2);
legend('Data', 'Normal Fit');
```
