# MATLAB Project Summary

Generate a technical overview of a MATLAB project. This tool analyzes MATLAB codebases and creates detailed summaries suitable for junior engineers and team members unfamiliar with the code.

## Metadata

- **Tags:** `matlab` `technical-doc` `software-engineering`
- **MATLAB Release:** All releases
- **Required Toolboxes:** None

## The Prompt

```text
You are an expert at reviewing and summarizing MATLAB code.  You analyze MATLAB code projects and create technical summaries for humans to review and learn about the code.
1. Prompt the user for the root directory on the local machine of a MATLAB project they wish to get a technical summary of
2. Confirm that you can read this directory
3. Create or revise a technical summary document for the code in this repository in markdown format.  
4. The intended audience is a junior engineer with no familiarity with the code base. 
5. Use the README.md for background and context.  

Format the documentation in GitHub-flavored Markdown and include:
- Code examples where relevant
- Mermaid diagrams for visualizing flows
- Clear section headers and subheaders
- Links to relevant external documentation or background information
- whenever a function or section of code is mentioned, create relative links to the source files, for example: [foo.m](./foo.m). 
  - When referencing specific line numbers: [foo.m:13](./foo.m#L13)
  - When referencing a block of code: [foo.m:1-20](./foo.m#L1-20)

Please ensure the documentation is clear, comprehensive, and maintainable.

The technical summary document should follow this structure:

# Project Overview
- Brief description
- Key features and capabilities
- Target audience and use cases

# User Experience

## Example Usage

## Function and Class Documentation
- For each function and method, provide a short summary of the purpose and basic usage

## User interaction flow

# Technical Overview
- Include version numbers and key dependencies

## Development Guide
- Setup instructions
- Environment variables (if appropriate)
- Local development workflow
- Testing procedures

### Areas for Improvement

### Potential Bugs

### Security Considerations

## System Architecture
- Create Mermaid diagrams for:
  - High-level component architecture
  - Detailed API interaction sequence
  - Location/state handling flow
- All diagrams should be properly formatted for GitHub Markdown

## Core Components

## Data Flow

- At the end, add the comment “This documentation was generated by AI.”
```

## Usage Tips

### This AI prompt helps you

- **Analyze MATLAB projects** by examining all `.m` files in your specified directory
- **Generate technical documentation** automatically in professional GitHub-flavored Markdown format
- **Create visual diagrams** using Mermaid to illustrate program flow and code architecture
- **Provide contextual links** to specific functions, files, and line numbers for easy navigation
- **Identify potential issues** including bugs, performance bottlenecks, and security considerations
- **Suggest improvements** with actionable recommendations for code enhancement

### Each generated documentation file includes

- **Code examples** with explanations
- **Mermaid diagrams** for visualizing program flow
- **Clear section structure** with headers and subheaders
- **Direct links** to source files and specific line numbers
- **Technical analysis** covering algorithms, performance, and potential issues

### Requirements

- **File System Access**: Your AI tool must be able to read and write files locally
- **MATLAB Project**: A directory containing `.m` files you want documented
- **Permissions**: Read/write access to your project directory

## Example Usage

### With Claude Desktop

1. Download this prompt from the GitHub repository
2. Open Claude Desktop
3. Copy and paste the entire prompt into a new conversation
4. Follow the AI's instructions to specify your MATLAB project directory
5. The AI will generate documentation files in your project folder

### With GitHub Copilot Chat

1. Download the prompt file to your local machine
2. Open your MATLAB project in VS Code
3. Open GitHub Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I)
4. Type `@workspace` followed by the prompt text
5. Specify your project root directory when prompted
6. Copilot will analyze and document your MATLAB files

## Expected Output

1. Analysis of each MATLAB source file (`.m` files)
2. Detailed technical documentation in markdown format
3. Documentation files alongside your source code (e.g., `foo.m` gets a `foo.m.md` file)

For a project with `signal_processor.m`, you'll get:

``` text
project/
├── signal_processor.m          # Your original MATLAB file
├── signal_processor.m.md       # Generated documentation
├── README.md                   # Project overview
└── other_files.m               # Other MATLAB files
```
