## About MATLAB App Building

MATLAB provides two main approaches for building apps:

- **App Designer:** Visual development environment for designing app layouts and programming behavior
- **Programmatic Apps:** Build apps entirely with code using uifigure and UI components

Both approaches use the same underlying UI components and can create web-deployable apps.

## Common Use Cases

- **Data Exploration Tools:** Interactive apps for visualizing and analyzing datasets
- **Parameter Tuning:** Apps for adjusting algorithm parameters with instant feedback
- **Educational Demos:** Interactive demonstrations for teaching concepts
- **Workflow Automation:** Custom tools to streamline repetitive tasks
- **Report Generation:** Apps that create automated reports with visualizations
