# AI Coding Agent Prompts for MATLAB

> A curated collection of prompts for AI coding assistants to enhance MATLAB&reg; development workflows

Prompts designed for use with MATLAB Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Sourcegraph Cody, and other AI coding assistants. These prompts help users write MATLAB code, create Live Scripts, work with MathWorks toolboxes, and streamline workflows.

## Categories

### üìù [Live Scripts & Documentation](prompts/live-scripts-documentation/)
Create Live Scripts, generate documentation, and format MATLAB help text for functions and scripts.

### üîß [Programming](prompts/programming/)
Optimize performance, handle errors, validate inputs, and write clean, efficient MATLAB code.

### ü§ñ [AI and Statistics](prompts/ai-and-statistics/)
Build neural networks, perform statistical analysis, train machine learning models, and analyze data.

### üì° [Signal Processing](prompts/signal-processing/)
Design filters, analyze spectra, process signals, and work with communications systems.

### üñºÔ∏è [Image Processing and Computer Vision](prompts/image-processing-and-computer-vision/)
Enhance images, detect features, segment objects, and process video streams.

### üìä [Data Visualization](prompts/data-visualization/)
Create professional plots, animations, and multi-panel figures with optimized performance and custom styling.

### üó∫Ô∏è [Mapping](prompts/mapping/)
Create world maps, analyze geospatial data, and visualize geographic information with custom projections.

### üéÆ [Control Systems](prompts/control-systems/)
Design controllers, analyze stability, tune parameters, and simulate dynamic systems.

### ‚öôÔ∏è [Code Generation](prompts/code-generation/)
Generate C/C++ code, create standalone applications, and deploy MATLAB algorithms to production.

## How to Use These Prompts

1. **Browse** the categories above to find a prompt that matches your task
2. **Copy** the prompt from the individual prompt file
3. **Customize** the placeholders (e.g., `[YOUR TOPIC HERE]`) with your specific requirements
4. **Paste** into your AI coding assistant (MATLAB Copilot, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, etc.)
5. **Iterate** - refine the output by providing additional context or constraints

### Tips for Best Results

- Be specific about MATLAB release requirements (e.g., R2024a+)
- Mention required toolboxes explicitly
- Provide example inputs/outputs when possible
- Ask for comments and documentation
- Request error handling and input validation
